# HAR_Framework


This human action recognition framework is an implementation for the purpose of classifying actions carried out by a human during industrial assembly tasks, in order to assist human-robot interactions.
To this purpose a dataset containing two assembly tasks were recorded, using a Kinect as RGB-D sensor. The RGB and depth information are used to determine the joint key points of human moevment, as well as the component objects during each frame.
